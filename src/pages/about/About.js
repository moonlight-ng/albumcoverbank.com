          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Cover Bank is Nigeria's largest digital archive of album artwork, home to over 5,300 stunning covers from 1950 to today. Each piece captures a moment in time, from the bold experiments of the 70s to the digital innovations of the present day.</p>
          <p>We're on a mission to celebrate two incredible stories: Nigeria's rich musical heritage and the brilliant designers who gave it its visual power. These artists shaped how the world saw Nigerian music, yet many of their names have been forgotten. Through extensive research, we're crafting the first complete history of Nigerian album cover design, finally giving these creators their due.</p>
          <p>Cover Bank isn't just an archive â€“ it's a living source of inspiration. Our collection draws in music historians piecing together cultural stories, designers seeking fresh perspectives, educators sharing Nigeria's visual legacy, and anyone captivated by the evolution of African design. Every cover tells a story of creativity, culture, and artistic innovation.</p>
          <p>This project is supportedby Independent Arts, a creative incubator dedicated to nurturing Nigerian artistry.</p>
